## Ball Movement
First, spend some time going through [this tutorial about animations in ProcessingJS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/animation-basics/p/making-animations), with the goal of animating a bouncing ball in mind.

Then, once you feel like you can do a bouncing ball, spin off an animation, call it "Paddle Ball" and work on getting a ball that moves and bounces off the walls.  For reference, the screen is 400 pixels wide.

## Paddle Movement
Once you have that working, go through the [mouse interaction tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/interactive-programs/p/mouse-interaction), with the goal of getting a paddle to follow your mouse in mind.

Once you feel like you can get a paddle to follow your mouse left and right (while staying in the same vertical position), go back to your spin off and work on that.

## Ball/Paddle Interaction
Once you have the paddle following your mouse, it's time to make it interact with the ball!

Use all your knowledge of ProcessingJS to get the ball to bounce when it hits the paddle!

## Lose condition

Now, if your ball goes all the way to the bottom of the screen, we want the user to lose.  So we should give the user a "Sorry, you lost!" message and reset the ball to the middle of the screen.

## Add bricks!

Now you're ready to upgrade your game into a version of Breakout (or Brick Breaker).
